<p>
    Professional strongman is one of the most exciting strength sports out there. If you've never watched it,
    imagine guys who are 6'3" and 400 pounds picking up massive boulders, flipping cars, and deadlifting
    over 1,000 pounds. It's not just about being big though, these athletes have to be fast, have great
    grip strength, and be conditioned enough to do events back to back. I got hooked on it a few years ago
    after watching clips on YouTube and now I follow pretty much every major competition.
</p>

<p>
    The biggest competition is World's Strongest Man (WSM), which has been running since 1977. It's the one
    most people have heard of, and legends like Mariusz Pudzianowski, Brian Shaw, and Hafthor Bjornsson
    (aka The Mountain from Game of Thrones) have all won it. Then there's the Arnold Strongman Classic
    which is usually considered the hardest single contest because the events are so heavy. The Rogue
    Invitational is a newer one that's gotten really big too. Right now the sport is kind of in a golden
    era with guys like Mitchell Hooper, Tom Stoltman, and Oleksii Novikov all competing at an insane level.

<p>
    What I love most about strongman compared to other strength sports is the variety of events. You've
    got deadlifts, log presses, atlas stones, farmer's walks, yoke carries, car deadlifts, and tons of
    other weird implements. Every competition is a little different so athletes can't just be good at one
    thing. The technique side is really underrated too, like how guys grip the atlas stones with tacky,
    or how they lap a stone before loading it over a bar. There's a lot more strategy than people think.
    It's not just "pick up heavy thing" even though that's basically what it looks like from the outside.

<p>
    That's Oleksii Novikov right after he won World's Strongest Man in 2020. He was only 24 which made him
    the youngest guy to ever win it. What's crazy about him is how fast he is for his size, like most of
    these guys are just raw power but Novikov moves like an athlete. He's from Ukraine and he absolutely
    smoked everyone in the Atlas Stones and Car Walk that year. He's won some other big titles too like
    World's Ultimate Strongman.

<p>
    And then there's Tom Stoltman. This picture is him with all three of his World's Strongest Man trophies
    which is just insane to look at. He won in 2021, 2022, and then again in 2024. The guy is 6'8" from
    Scotland and his Atlas Stones might be the best ever, he literally holds the world record. Him and his
    brother Luke both compete which is pretty cool, you'll see them at basically every major show together.

<p>
    This is Brian Shaw doing a Hummer tire deadlift which is one of the craziest looking events in strongman.
    Shaw has won World's Strongest Man four times (2011, 2013, 2015, 2016) and the Arnold Classic too. He's
    6'8" and walks around at like 440 pounds so the dude is just massive. He's kind of transitioned into
    being a YouTube guy now but he still competes sometimes. Definitely one of the all time greats.
