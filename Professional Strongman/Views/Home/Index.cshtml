<p>
    Professional strongman is one of the most exciting strength sports out there. If you've never watched it,
    imagine guys who are 6'3" and 400 pounds picking up massive boulders, flipping cars, and deadlifting
    over 1,000 pounds. It's not just about being big though, these athletes have to be fast, have great
    grip strength, and be conditioned enough to do events back to back. I got hooked on it a few years ago
    after watching clips on YouTube and now I follow pretty much every major competition.
</p>

<p>
    The biggest competition is World's Strongest Man (WSM), which has been running since 1977. It's the one
    most people have heard of, and legends like Mariusz Pudzianowski, Brian Shaw, and Hafthor Bjornsson
    (aka The Mountain from Game of Thrones) have all won it. Then there's the Arnold Strongman Classic
    which is usually considered the hardest single contest because the events are so heavy. The Rogue
    Invitational is a newer one that's gotten really big too. Right now the sport is kind of in a golden
    era with guys like Mitchell Hooper, Tom Stoltman, and Oleksii Novikov all competing at an insane level.

<p>
    What I love most about strongman compared to other strength sports is the variety of events. You've
    got deadlifts, log presses, atlas stones, farmer's walks, yoke carries, car deadlifts, and tons of
    other weird implements. Every competition is a little different so athletes can't just be good at one
    thing. The technique side is really underrated too, like how guys grip the atlas stones with tacky,
    or how they lap a stone before loading it over a bar. There's a lot more strategy than people think.
    It's not just "pick up heavy thing" even though that's basically what it looks like from the outside.

<h3>Oleksii Novikov</h3>

<p>
    Oleksii Novikov out of Ukraine became the youngest World's Strongest Man champion in 2020 when he was
    only 24. The dude is insanely fast and explosive which is kind of unusual for strongman. He dominated
    events like the Atlas Stones and Car Walk and honestly just looked like he was on another level that year.
    He's also won the World's Ultimate Strongman title and has been on the podium at Europe's Strongest Man.

<h3>Tom Stoltman</h3>

<p>
    Tom Stoltman from Scotland is probably the most dominant strongman right now. He's won World's Strongest
    Man three times (2021, 2022, and 2024) and he's only getting better. At 6'8" the guy is massive and
    his Atlas Stones are basically untouchable - he holds the world record. He also won Europe's Strongest
    Man. Him and his brother Luke compete together a lot which is pretty cool to watch.

<h3>Brian Shaw</h3>

<p>
    Brian Shaw is a legend in the sport. Four-time World's Strongest Man (2011, 2013, 2015, 2016) and
    he's also won the Arnold Strongman Classic which a lot of people consider the hardest competition.
    At 6'8" and over 400 pounds he's one of the biggest guys to ever compete. He's famous for his
    deadlift strength and the photo above shows him doing a Hummer tire deadlift which is one of the
    most iconic strongman events. Even though he's getting older he's still competing and he runs a
    huge YouTube channel now too.
